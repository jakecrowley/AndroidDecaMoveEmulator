# Joycon DecaMove Emulator
A WIP DecaMove emulator for Joycons. 

~~I am working on removing the need for com0com, it already works by hooking directly into the service and bypassing the serial communication, however the software still needs to see the serial connection in order to work :(~~ Done!

## WIP Features

- ~~Remove need for third party software~~ Done!
- Haptic Feedback support
- Correct battery indicator

## Installation

1. Install DecaHub.

2. Clone the github repository and build from source or download the zip archive from Releases and extract all files.

3. Connect Joycon to PC via Bluetooth.

4. Run DecaMoveEmulator.exe!

5. SteamVR should start automatically, calibrate by holding controllers close together at your waist while looking forward, and launch any compatible game from DecaHub.
